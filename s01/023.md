# Compound Assignment With Augmented Multiplication

The `*=` operator multiplies a variable by a number.

```javascript
myVar = myVar * 5;
```

will multiply `myVar` by `5`. This can be rewritten as:

```javascript
myVar *= 5;
```

**Task**: Convert the assignments for `a`, `b`, and `c` to use the `*=` operator.
