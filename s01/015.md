# Increment a Number with JavaScript

You can easily increment or add one to a variable with the `++` operator.

```javascript
i++;
```

is the equivalent of

```javascript
i = i + 1;
```

*Note*: The entire line becomes `i++;`, eliminating the need for the equal sign.

**Task**: Change the code to use the `++` operator on `myVar`.
